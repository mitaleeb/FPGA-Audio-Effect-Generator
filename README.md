# FPGA-Audio-Effect-Generator
Our project is an audio effect generator â€” from a given audio input on our phones, we perform various different DSP effects on the signal before outputting it again through the headphone jack on the DE2-115 board. The main DSP effects that were created are volume control, various frequency filters (low pass, high pass, band-pass) and reverb effect. In addition, we were able to create a visualizer using VGA monitor display of all the given samples as a waveform visual. The effect generator is user controlled, so different switches control which DSP effect is desired. In general, if DSP is enabled, then the desired DSP effect will be performed and listened to on the headphones. The mode of DSP will also be displayed on the hex displays utilizing ASCII 7-segment display data. These are all controlled using the buttons and switches on the DE2-115 board. This project primarily be implemented using SystemVerilog, but the equalizer waveform logic is written using the SoC in C. SystemVerilog interfaces with the hardware components of the DE2-115 board, namely the audio input and outputs, the VGA display, the HEX displays, switches, buttons, and the NIOS-II processor. The final demo can be carried out either using earbuds, headphones, or an external speaker, as well as a VGA accepting monitor. The foundation audio driver has been provided and indicated as such in the source code. Please refer to our appendix for any resources referred to online.
